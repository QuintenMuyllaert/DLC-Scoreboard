### Usage

On Debian/Ubuntu based machines, you can run `sudo bash ./install.sh` after cloning the repository. This will install the dependencies of the project.

For manual installation you will need npm, git, pm2 and a running mongodb database.

`./Backend/` will need a file named `.env` this file includes the secret (autogenerated after first run) and the mongodb database connection string.

```.env
TOKEN_SECRET=...
MONGO_CONNECTION=mongodb://...
```

To update and launch the program run `sudo bash ./ci.sh`
